\title{Launch the Maxent Java Application from the dismo Package}
\usage{
maxent_open()
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the result of the system call (integer exit status
on most platforms). Stops with an informative error if unsuccessful.
}
\description{
This function locates and launches the Maxent Java application (\code{maxent.jar})
that is distributed with the \code{dismo} R package. It performs robust checks for
required package installations, the presence of Java, and the availability of
the JAR file. If all checks pass, it attempts to launch the Maxent graphical
user interface using your system's Java installation.
}
\details{
\strong{Note:} This function works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, provided that
Java is correctly installed and available on your system PATH. The function
does not attempt to modify any system configurations. For headless (server)
environments, the GUI may not be displayed.

Maxent is a Java-based application for species distribution
modelling. The \code{dismo} package bundles the Maxent JAR file and provides R
wrappers for interacting with it. This function is a convenience to open
the Maxent GUI from within R.

If Java is not installed or not found on your PATH, or if Maxent is missing
from the expected location, informative errors will be given. The function
returns (invisibly) the result from the system call to launch Maxent.
